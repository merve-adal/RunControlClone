In the game, our character runs on a flat ground. There are numerical blocks and obstacles on this ground. Numeric blocks consist of four operations, the number of characters changes accordingly. Our character needs to avoid the obstacles. The obstacles include a needle box, saw, sledgehammer and propeller. There are also characters that we can collect on the way, and the number of characters can be increased by collecting these characters. At the end of the level, there is a region I call the battlefield. There are enemy characters in this area. When our character comes to this part, there is a battle. If the number of enemies is more than the number of characters, the same level is played again. If not, the next level is passed. In the customization section of the menus, items such as hats and sticks can be purchased and added to the character, and the color of the character can also be changed. In addition, the sound of both the menu and the game can be adjusted as desired.
